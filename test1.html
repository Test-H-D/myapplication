	My mother is a very sensitive person who always cares about others’ feelings and never hurts them. She has a great quality of assuming everyone as her own self to avoid hurting others. She has taught me to be very sensitive when I associate with others, because every person has their own story that has never been exposed to society. When we try to criticize someone without knowing him or her, it might be painful for them.
She always tells me to assume others as myself and not to do anything I don’t like to face. This made me a sensitive person towards others. I never criticize someone without knowing his or her story, and I never hurt their feelings. This has made me closer friends with others who listen to them when they are in trouble. Giving them advice as much as possible and helping my best to solve their problems makes my life better and I feel proud of my mom for making a warm child that carries her good heart and qualities.

	<p > <strong>What is a small paragraph?</strong>
<em>A short paragraph might be only two or three sentences long.</em> Paragraph length, however, is relative to the surrounding paragraphs. If your document contains much longer paragraphs, a paragraph of five or six sentences might be considered short. Identify the main idea of your paragraph. </p>
	
	<p> Components of a Short Essay. The standard five-paragraph short essays have specific structure:<u> introduction (1 paragraph), thesis, main body (3 paragraphs), and conclusion (1 paragraph)</u>. <br>This helps your work be elaborately structured and easier to comprehend.</p>
